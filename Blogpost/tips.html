        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Before we get into the tips, I just want to say that consistent preparation will always outperform these types
          of tricks. Some of these tips will guide you in your preparation, but they will also help you crammers! So let's get started!
</body>
</p>

<br>
<br>
<h3>General Tips</h3>
<h4><strong>Tip 1: </strong>Skip through difficult questions for each section: </h4>
<p>
  This advice seems obvious and is very well-known, however you can take this advice to another level. The original purpose of this tip was so you get the points from easy questions and then gamble on the hard ones. But there are more benefits to
  this. For instance, you’re on a reading passage, and can’t figure out an inference question. By going back to it after you finish the test, you look at it with a fresh pair of eyes, and often that could help you determine the answer. However, I
  don’t recommend skipping detail or very specific questions as you could end up forgetting parts of the passage that could’ve helped you answer it. Grammar questions are always fine to skip along with math. Another reason this works is that after
  doing the other easier questions, you get more in the “zone” and are able to better approach the harder questions.
</p>

<h4><strong>Tip 2: </strong>Bring a digital stopwatch with you:</h4>
<p>
  It’s easy to lose track of time. Having a digital stopwatch watch on your wrist will help you keep track of time
  conveniently. Pacing is super important especially on the reading section where it’s easy to lose track of time. there
  are some sections that are time intense like the Writing section with 44 questions in 35 minutes. Digital stopwatch helps you Check
  the time frequently without spending too much time figuring out how much time has passed.
</p>



<img src="images/watch.png" class="center-images" alt="">
<br id="understand">

<h4><strong>Tip 3: </strong>Get a good night’s sleep and prepare your materials</h4>
<p>
  Make sure you have all the necessary materials: ID, #2 pencils, a calculator (make sure it’s fully charged), bottle of water, a digital watch. Sleep at least 7-8 hours so that you’re well rested. By getting these things out of the way, you can
  hopefully
  reduce your anxiety. Maybe visit your test center beforehand so that you feel more comfortable on test day.
</p>
<br>

<h4><strong>Tip 4: </strong>Bubble your answers in groups of 5-10:</h4>
<p>
  Bubbling right after a question is scientifically slower than bubbling 5-10 questions at once. Although this seems minuscule, you actually get distracted and lose focus while switching between answering questions and bubbling answers. Follow it if
  you wish. It’s important to practice tests
  with a scantron so that you account for bubbling time and distraction if you bubble after every question.
</p>

<h4><strong>Tip 5: </strong>Review a practice test during Breakfast:</h4>

<p>
  This tip works for some people, but the point is to go over a very content-dense practice test that has a lot of tricks and strategies you implemented. By reviewing your approaches to the reading passages, grammar rules/tricks, and math formulae,
  you get your mind in the zone and ready. Often times, students start the reading passages off a bit shaky or unstructured. By reviewing
  a good test before the real test, you prime your brain for the reading passages that are about to come.
</p>

<h4><strong>Tip 6: </strong>Eliminate, Eliminate, Eliminate!!!</h4>
<p>
  Actively cross out wrong answers that are not possible at all. It allows you to hone in on the differences between the actual candidates. This is a very important strategy especially in the reading section because students always find themselves in
  the “I couldn’t choose between those two and guessed” situation. There are often two very similar answer choices in the reading questions, but you have to identify which is the “best” answer by recognizing a flaw in one of the answer choices. There
  is a always a objective reason for an answer to be right, so be as logical and evidence-based as you can. Even inference questions only require very subtle inferences. Here is an example, question 4 from test 1:
</p>

<img src="images/q1.png" class="center-images" alt="">
<p>
  For context, a boy named Akira is asking Chie, a mother, for her daughter’s hand in marriage. He is taking an unconventional route to do this because he needs to move to America quickly. He says “Please don’t judge my candidacy by the unseemliness
  of this proposal.”
  Essentially, Akira is fearing rejection because Chie might think that his way of asking wasn’t right. Note that many of these answer choices say similar things. HOWEVER, each word has different meaning and connotations, and you need to scrutinize
  each word.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A. Consider proposal inappropriate. Seems okay? Inappropriate seems like a weird way to say it? Let’s leave it.</li>
  <li>B. Earnestness? He isn’t earnest, he is simply asking for marriage because he needs to move to America quickly. And immaturity? I know you guys don’t have context, but take a read at Passage 1, on Test #1. You shouldn’t see any signs of
    immaturity, but rather you’ll see maturity through the responsible steps he’s taking.</li>
  <li>C. Unscheduled visit? Yes that’s true. Seems good so far. Imposition? What does that mean? Seems overall right, so I guess this is the right answer. No!! If you don’t know the meaning of a word, be careful. It’s a trick to get you to pick it.
    Imposition means a strain or pressing action. Akira’s visit is in no way an inconvenience for Chie nor does it put pressure on her. She can do whatever she wishes and feels no pressure from Akira. </li>
  <li>D. Underestimate the sincerity of his emotions. This is perfectly possible. Since he is coming in such an odd way, she might think he’s insincere. BUT, there is NO evidence that shows this. This is just a very likely scenario. You cannot assume
    this to be true. Think like a lawyer. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The only answer that isn’t totally wrong is A. Notice how harsh and critical I am of each answer choice. You need to go based on the evidence. Although A didn’t sound right, it was right. The test is crafted like this to get students fall for the
  other choices. Note there was a paired evidence question with this one, but I honed in the right evidence.
</p>

<h4><strong>Tip 7: </strong>Focus and Underline:</h4>
<p>
  Read actively and focus on keywords such as concluding statements, transition words, etc. Underlining helped me understand the main point of each answer choice and understand the question. It also helped me look back on the passage when looking for
  certain things. For the grammar section, it helped me for comprehension questions because I was able to see transitions and the main idea. Underlining doesn’t mean to mark up the whole page. You want to go fast, and just mark a couple words per
  paragraph—the keywords. The Erica Meltzer Reading Guidebook does a good job of helping you identify these keywords.

<h3>Reading Tips:</h3>
<br>
<img src="images/q2.png" class="center-images" alt="">
<h4><strong>Tip 8: </strong>Skim the background passage at the top.</h4>
<p>
  No need to understand it too much, just pick up some key terms that tell you what the passage is about. The example below is from the first passage on the first passage. The first 1.5 lines aren’t that helpful, which is why we skim. The key things
  we pick up is that the story takes place in Japan, which might be helpful context. We also get introduced to two characters: Chie and Naomi, who are mother and daughter.
</p>

<br>
<br>
<img src="images/strategy.png" class="center-images" alt="">
<h4><strong>Tip 9: </strong>Approach each passage type with a certain strategy</h4>
<p>
  What I mean by this is that each type of passage (Fiction, Social Science, Science, History, Paired-Passages) have different question types and different things you need to be on the lookout for. A quick example is that fiction passages generally
  ask about character relationships, actions, and values or things they believe in. Rather than focusing on understanding the details or surroundings, hone in on what the characters do and think about what that shows about them. If you’re struggling
  with any one specific type of passage, I recommend reading Erica Meltzer’s guide and getting the corresponding IES Reading Passage books which are available by passage type. Only get these if you can afford to, there are more important resources
  out there, this is just an extra step. Note the difficulty of these passages are much harder and train you for the real test.
</p>

<h4><strong>Tip 10: </strong>Read with Purpose and Passion:</h4>
<p>
  This is obviously not reading for fun; you are here to answer questions. But, try to enjoy the process as much as you can. I’m not a fan of the SAT passages, but some of them can be quite educational, especially the science or social science
  passages. The more interest you show, the more likely you are to be consistent with your preparation and the more involved you’ll be when reading the passages.
</p>
<h4><strong>Tip 11: </strong>Base Each Answer From the Text:</h4>
<p>
  The point of this tip is to back every answer of yours from the passage. Don’t infer ANYTHING. You can see this from the example in the Eliminate, Eliminate, Eliminate tip. Always weigh things you know 100%>likely possibilities. Don’t get swayed by
  correct-sounding answers. Often, the right answer doesn’t sound right, but it is. Correct answers are generally neutral or make a slight stance in their statement. Extreme answers are often wrong because they involve assumptions. If you want to
  describe a high school track regional champion. “He is fast” is a correct statement. “He is the fastest” may be wrong. Go on the evidence. Be a lawyer.
</p>
<img src="images/detective.png" class="center-images" alt="">

<h4><strong>Tip 12: </strong>Focus on the intro and concluding sentence:</h4>
<p>
  The intro and concluding sentences usually showcase more about the purpose of the paragraph and what’s going to happen. This is most prevalent in the science passages that are more structured. You can ignore this advice for fiction and history
  passages. Those don’t have structured paragraphs.
</p>

<h4><strong>Tip 13: </strong>Answer detail/specifics questions first:</h4>
<p>
  By answering these questions first, you have referred back to the passage a few times, and each time you do this, you’re able to understand the passage as a whole much better. This extra understanding goes a long way in helping you answer other
  question types such as Main Idea, author’s purpose, or Inference questions.
</p>

<h4><strong>Tip 14: </strong>Vocab Questions Advice:</h4>
<p>
  Be careful of very bold/assertive terms. The more neutral they are the better. The right word may not sound the best, but as long as its definition fits in the most, it should be right. A strategy is to always plug the words in and read how it
  sounds. These answer choices can sometimes be grouped into positive/negative type of categories. Also make sure to read the lines before and after the place where the sentence is inserted. These lines often contain the key to choosing the right
  word.
</p>

<h4><strong>Tip 15: </strong>If you don’t know a definition, play the eliminate game:</h4>
<p>
  Unfortunately, you won’t know the definition to every word on the SAT. If you have an answer choice with such a word, you want to scrutinize the other choices. If you’re able to eliminate them, then by process of elimination, you should be able to
  solve the question. Don’t pick or eliminate a choice just because of a unknown word, try to analyzed the other parts of the choice to help.
</p>


<h4><strong>Tip 16: </strong>During preparation, analyze the passage:</h4>
<p>
  Through the use of a course or book, really observe where answers where hidden in the text. Understand what lines gave away what answers. Highlight, underline, circle, and really dig into the passage and UNDERSTAND what it was saying through the
  extra time during review. Do the same thing for the questions, find the reason that each answer was wrong. The best resources for this are 1600.io and The Black Book.

<h3>Writing Section Tips:</h3>

<h4><strong>Tip 17: </strong>Concisness is Key</h4>
<p>
  Many problems test more than just basic grammar. A common theme tested is how concise and succinct a sentence is.
</p>
<img src="images/q3.png" class="center-images" alt="">
<p>
  Notice how answer choice A, C, and D all repeat information that was already stated or implied. B is the most concise and clear without repeating any information.
</p>
<img src="images/q4.png" class="center-images" alt="">
<p>
  Here is another example with #23. The sentence already has the words “off quickly.” This conveys the fact that the object had worn off quickly. Answer choice A, B, and C all repeat this information by saying “soon” and “promptly.” You can also see
  that answer choice C is shorter than B, and you always want to go for the shorter answer when picking between two. In this case, the answer is D since it’s shortest and doesn’t repeat ANY information.
</p>

<h4><strong>Tip 18: </strong>Skim the passage again to answer any Comprehension questions such as sentence order, sentence addition/deletion, author’s purpose or main idea. </h4>
<p>
  The reason for this is that you need to understand the context of the passage as a whole to be able to answer these questions. Since I have to reread anyways, what I do is go through the whole test or passage doing only grammar related questions.
  After that, I reread the passage with an intent to solve only comprehension-related questions. This helps because I’m focusing on one type of task. Switching between grammar and comprehension can be difficult to do, and that’s why I took this
  approach.
</p>

<h4><strong>Tip 19: </strong>Keep track of time on this section:</h4>
<p>
  This section goes by fast, with only 35 minutes for 44 questions. You don’t have the time to ponder hard on questions. Run through the test quickly, skipping hard questions, and then get to them at the end. If you have your grammar rules studied
  and have practiced a lot, you should be able to easily run through this section with extra time.
</p>

<h4><strong>Tip 20: </strong>Practice, Practice, and Practice!!!</h4>
<p>
  The questions asked in this section follow a very predictable pattern. I got 24 questions wrong on my PSAT in 10th grade. After studying and doing over 15 real practice tests, I got a perfect score on this section on my 11th grade PSAT and got only
  1 wrong on my SAT. It’s the same questions just repeated over and over again. Learn them, and you will master this section. Even the comprehension/word choice questions can be mastered to an extent; just do enough questions before the test, and you
  will develop an intuition for which words they’re looking for and why.

<br>
<h3>Math Section Tips</h3>
<br>
<img src="images/speed.png" class="center-images" alt="">
<h4><strong>Tip 21: </strong>Work on speed for the non-calculator section:</h4>
<p>
  The questions asked here are also very predictable and you can practice and prepare for them even if you’re bad at math. There is almost always a linear equation in the multiple choice such as: 2x+6=54. These questions are simple, but if you
  practice them before hand you can zoom through this section and double check for silly mistakes.
</p>


<h4><strong>Tip 22: </strong>If you’re missing over 5 questions, work on learning content first:</h4>
<p>
  Tips are useful and everything, but they have their limits. You need to have the content knowledge to answer these questions. If you only have a day or two, you can still cram. Just go through real practice tests and learn more about the topic of
  questions that you missed.
</p>


<h4><strong>Tip 23: </strong>Know the ins and outs of the calculator:</h4>
<p>
  For the calculator section, you can really use your calculator to do the grunt work. Although, you still need to understand the meaning of what your calculator shows you. There are so many tricks in this that we had to create a separate guide.
</p>



<h4><strong>Tip 24: </strong>Make sure to answer the question:</h4>
<p>
  They could ask for 3x instead of x, or insert other tricks, so stay sharp and read closely on the word problems.
  Not much else for math, it’s a very straightforward section.
</p>


<br>

<h3>Experience and Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>

  As I mentioned in the title of this article, I did dramatically improve my score, but it took a lot of persistence and motivation. If you really want to get that dream score, you have to consistently prepare and stay on top of it. If you
  follow the advice above and prepare genuinely, you should be able to get 1500+. DON’T GET DISCOURAGED IF YOU DON’T GET UR DREAM SCORE ON YOUR FIRST ATTEMPT. This test isn't about your iq or anything, it's about how well you know how to take
  the SAT.
  Once you learn the ins and outs, you will get your dream score. Often times, students from poorer backgrounds don't find out about these <a href="tricks.html">tricks and tips</a> and that's why you see a score correlation with wealth. But
  now you have the resources. Now you just have to really want that score, so start grinding!
