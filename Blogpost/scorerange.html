          The information below is by no means an exact guideline for prospective students. I am not an admissions officer. However, this blog post has
          compiled research and has a single goal: to help students get a general feel of an SAT score range students should aim for to be competent for
          their dream college.

        <h3>My Background</h3>
        <p>
          I’m not one of those naturally high scorers. My PSAT score in 10th grade was a 1240. After spending months of preparation, I’ve finally gotten a 1560. I mainly struggled on the English section and breezed through the math section which is
          the easiest or most masterable section. For all those out there who struggle in English and breeze through the math, this is the resource page for you!! This article is primarily intended for students in the 1100-1400s range. If I was able
          to turn my score around, there is no reason why you can’t. This article will go through the topic about score ranges and the looming question of whether you should retake the SAT.

        <h3>COVID-19 SAT Changes</h3>
        <p>
          With COVID-19, lots of schools (from selective to local ones) have enforced a <strong>test-optional</strong> policy for the SAT and ACT. This means that you can not take the SAT and still not be penalized for it. However,
          for test-optional schools, showing a stellar SAT score can still show academic prepardness, so we still recommend taking the exam. GPA and extracurriculars often have showing academic preparnedness as each school has different standards.
          The SAT is a standardized way to show prepardness.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you <strong>do</strong> want to take the SAT, you should check <a href="https://blog.prepscholar.com/test-optional-colleges-list">this</a> link to see which colleges do optional testing based on state. Also, be wary of the difference
          between
          test-optional schools and <strong>test-blind</strong> schools. Test-blind schools <strong>do not</strong> consider your SAT scores while judging your application, so if you're set on signing up for test-blind schools, you should know that
          those
          schools will judge you based on your GPA, circumstances, and extra curriculars, but not your SAT score.

        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <p>
          Talking about Score Ranges <strong>can</strong> get a little tricky, so it always helps to get familiarized with common terms.

                the 1400s,
                but those are outliers.(Remember these schools have recruited athletes and ultra rich students)</td>

        <h3>What is a Good SAT Score Range</h3>
        <p>
          The word "good" may differ from person to person, depending on whether you're aiming to go to Harvard or your local state university. However, if you're thinking about scoring above the 50th percentile, that is higher than 50 percent of
          test takers, you must get above 1059.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're aiming above the 50th percentile, this is a good guideline for you. However, if you clicked on this article, you are probably trying to aim for something higher. In that case, here is an approximate table of SAT score ranges:

          This table only has score ranges from the average to the score ceiling: 1600. This table is also based on 2019 SAT scores. Based on this graph, getting a score of 1200, which is only 140 points higher than the average, puts you above around
          3/4 of test takers, making you pretty
          competent for schools with 50-80% acceptance rates. With a bit of studying, a person who theoretically scores around 1060 could get into their local state university with a 1200, brightening their application. Scoring a 1400 or more places
          you above 95% of test takers, which as a result
          makes you very competitive for most schools (except for selective schools like the Ivies and some others). To appear more competitive to schools, scorers with a 1500 or above are placed at the tippy top, the 99th percentile. Scorers with
          scores around this SAT Score Range are very competitive for most colleges, and have a semi-fair chance at selective schools.

        <p>
          Okay, so what <strong>is</strong> a <strong>good</strong> SAT score range? The answer depends on you. If you want to have a chance at the most selective schools, you should try to get your SAT score at or as close to the 1500 barrier as
          possible. If you want to have a good shot at getting to your local university, scoring 3/4 higher than test takers, or getting a 1200 or higher, is a
          good score. Remember, if you want to change your SAT score, you can always practice with resources <a href="">here</a> or tips <a href="">here</a>.

        <h3>Score Ranges for Competitive Schools</h3>
        <p>
          The word "competitive" could seem arbitrary. However, for this purpose, we'll define competitive as schools that have an acceptance rate <strong>at or below</strong> 30%. This includes schools that you may have never heard from to
          prestigious schools like the Ivies and the UCs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>DISCLAIMER: This section is compiled based on a mix of research and prior knowledge.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to go to a school that has an acceptance rate that is between 25-30% acceptance rate, the 25th percentile is somewhere 1250-1350, meaning that to be "in the running" for these selective schools, you need to score above the
          80-90th percentile on the SAT. This is a very hard feat to accomplish, so if you want to learn how to raise your SAT score to your liking, you can check <a href="">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to go to a school that has an acceptance rate that is below 25%, you'd need to score 1400 or higher (or 1500+ for some extra-selective schools). This requires you to score beyond the 95th percentile. This demands lots of
          studying and practice.
          You can always find tips to raise your score <a href="tips.html">here</a> and <a href="">here</a>.
        </p>
        <br>

        <br id="compscore_selective">
        <br>
        <p>If you're thinking "Hey, I only need to aim for the 25th percentile to be in the running", your thinking is greatly flawed, especially for highly competitive schools. Students who are accepted to highly competitive colleges and score in or
          below the 25th
          percentile are typically stellar in every other category. They usually have a 4.0 GPA, are a captain of a sports club, a recruited athlete, an International medalist, a major non-profit organizer, or something equally recognizable. So if
          you do not have
          extreme credentials, you should try to ideally aim for the 50th percentile to have a decent shot at a college. </p>

        <h3>SAT Score Range Chart for the Most Selective Schools</h3>
        <p>
          For especially selective schools, SAT Score Ranges vary drastically, from some schools having a 75th percentile score range of the 1480 to some having one near the 1600 mark. Here is a table of some very selective schools and their SAT
          score ranges:

          This table shows that a person must score around a 1500 or even above a 1550 to have a competitive SAT score. Scoring at this Score Range requires a lot of general skill and practice. If you're not aiming for this goal, however, there are

        <h3>Other Ways to Determine SAT Score Range</h3>
        <p>
          If you're wondering what SAT score do you need to get into another school, like University of Washington, you could find the 25th/75th percentile by a google search. And in summary, aim your target score to be in the 50th percentile of that
          college.
        </p>
        <p>
          Search up <strong>[School Name] SAT Score</strong> and you'll usually find your school's 25th and 75th percentile SAT scores on the top.

          From this image, you can add the low-end reading and math scores to get the 25th percentile and the high-end ones to get the 75th percentile scores.

          Just remember, you don't <strong>need</strong> to stress over your SAT score. It is not the end of the world. Always know that colleges look for more things besides SAT score, and while SAT <strong>is</strong>
          is a big deciding factor (not for the 2020-2021 school year), it is not the ultimatum of whether you get into your dream college or not. So take the SAT, be done with it, and do whatever is in your favor to help you reach that
          goal.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Main Purpose of Score Ranges:</strong> By seeing these ranges, you can start crafting a college list. Of course, just because you have a 1550, don't put an Ivy as a match, any school with acceptance rates below 15% are difficult to
          get into despite high SAT scores.
          See more on our <a href="collegelist">article</a> how to craft a college list</p>
        <h3>Note on Majors</h3>
        <p>Some extremely competitive majors such as Computer Science have much lower acceptance rates than the overall school. A great example for this is UC Berkeley. While the general school of L&S is ~17%, the EECS major acceptance rate is ~8%. Keep this in mind.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Should I Retake the SAT?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>This question is very hard to answer, as it involves many variables. For examaple, one variable is whether you can afford to pay for multiple SAT retakes or not. A lower-income student who scored a 1280 on their first try may not get the
          opportunity
          to retake because of money. In that case, you should check out <a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/k12-educators/advising-instruction/requesting-fee-waivers">this</a> to see a in-depth tutorial on how to see if you're
          eligible for SAT fee waivers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another variable is your first score. If you scored a 1530 on your first SAT, and are thinking about taking another SAT, you should not do it. A 1530 is already a highly competitive score for all colleges, even Ivies, and getting a 1580
          will be almost
          weighted the same in the grand scheme of things (ex: when a Harvard admissions officer is comparing your score to another applicant's). This same thing can be applicable to 1400s and even a 1350 (if you're only signing up for universities
          that have above a 45%
          acceptance rate). However, if you're looking to get into reach schools and you scored a 1150 on your first test, definitely do try applying again. However, try not to sign up more than three times. Some colleges can request to see all SAT
          attempts and might
          feel like you're redoing the SAT solely because you want to look good for college. You can find which colleges require all SAT Scores <a href="http://nphs.org/counseling/documents/CollegesAllSATScores.pdf">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Of course if you took it only once, it might be worth it to give it another shot. But if you have taken it multiple times and are at a decent score, retaking may not be the most productive use of your time. This is why we don't recommend
          retaking scores that are in the 1500-1540 range, because they are high enough, and you can boost your chances much more by doing more activities or writing better essays. In the end,
          the SAT is more like a checkbox, is this student academically ready for the school? 1500+? Great, you definitely are. 1480? You are but you could also improve.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="images/studylaptop.png" class="center-images" alt="retake">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          A smaler, but still important, variable is the date. If you're a senior and are deciding to take the SAT in November or December, then you should check when your schools request you to send your scores/early decision before deciding when to
          retake. If you're
          a junior, date doesn't matter for you; you can take the test whenever, but you should ideally take it after your prep class/when you are the most fresh.
        </p>
        <p>Now back to the question: Should I Retake the SAT with a 1490? The answer is <strong>yes</strong>. A 1490 has a good amount of wiggle room that you can improve. My first SAT was a 1460. This test is heavily luck based when you get near
          1500, a couple questions can be the difference between you getting a 1540 or 1470.</p>
