        <h3>My Background</h3>
        <p>
          I’m not one of those naturally high scorers. My PSAT score in 10th grade was a 1240. After spending months of preparation, I’ve finally gotten my highest combined score to 1530. I mainly struggled on the English section and breezed through
          the math section which is the easiest or most masterable section for most people. For all those out there who struggle in English and breeze through the math, this is the resource page for you!! This article is primarily intended for
          students in the 1100-1400s range. If I was able to turn my score around, there is no reason why you can’t. This article will go through the preparation process.
          Here are two drop down buttons where you can find a summary and a table of contents. This will help you read the condensed info if you’re short on time.

        <h3>Preparation Timeline</h3>
        <p>
          Depending on the hours you spend per day and your starting score, the amount of time needed to prepare will differ from person to person. Generally, to maximize your score in math, one month should be plenty to cover all the topics and go
          through enough practice problems. As for the English section, this requires more time. If you’re scoring anywhere in the 500-600 range, I recommend preparing for at least 3 months if you intend to reach the 700 mark. If you’re already
          scoring somewhere in the 600-700 range, I recommend ~2 months of preparation. You can find many good study tables and prep routines online such as <a href="https://www.yout/watv=ZpLOQICr2Wc">here</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the linked video, Kelly goes through her SAT study routine, but her schedule was during school. My recommendation is to spend the summer before junior year preparing if you have a low score. That way you can really understand the ins and
          outs of the test, and possibly get some real experience in the October, November, and Decembers dates. This approach is really beneficial because you won’t feel the pressure some of the seniors feel when their test date is the last one
          before college apps.

        </p>
        <p>
          You also need the right mentorship or books to get you through all of this. Check out my article on <a href="resources.html">Top SAT resources</a> to learn about the books and courses I used. I provide relatively cheap and free resources,
          and there are many online pdfs to these books as well.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          If you notice, I might mention books that aren't as famous as the usual Barrons or PrincetonReview. The reason for this is that most prep books out there don't provide accurate questions that resemble the real SAT questions.
          Always go for quality over quantity. Most of the questions you do should come from the real tests unless you are learning content. Practice tests from other companies don't mean much and aren't going to help significantly.

          Another waste of time is that if you are already scoring 800s on for example the math section, then you don't need to take the math section ever saturday. Instead you could just go through the English section. Remember, cover your weak
