          I’m not one of those naturally high scorers. My PSAT score in 10th grade was a 1240. After spending months of preparation, I’ve finally gotten a 1560. I mainly struggled on the English section and breezed through the math section which is
          the easiest or most masterable section. For all those out there who struggle in English and breeze through the math, this is the resource page for you!! This article is primarily intended for students in the 1100-1400s range. If I was able
          to turn my score around, there is no reason why you can’t. This article will go through the topic about score ranges and the looming question of whether you should retake the SAT.

<h3>Standardized Tests and their Meaning</h3>
<p>If you're looking to see which test is easier, there is no general answer. Both are equivalent in difficult for the average population, however there are key differences which may affect your performance.</p>
<p>A standardized test has a purpose of comparing you to students from across the nation, and thus if one was easier, its scores wouldn't be valued as much, so let's dig into which one you should take.</p>

        <br id="scorerangeterm">
        <br>
        <h3>Differences By Section:</h3>
        <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/vs.png" alt="">
        <h3>Reading</h3>
        <p>
        If you struggle in Reading, this section could be a game changer, so let's compare the reading sections.
        </p>

        <table class="terminologytable">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th class="tbordersolid">SAT</th>
              <th class="tbordersolid">Qualities</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="tbordersolid">More Time</td>
              <td class="tbordersolid">With 52 questions in 65 minutes. Although this is because of question difficulty, you get more time to read the passsages. If you are slow at reading or skimming, this is one reason to consider SAT</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="tbordersolid">More Complicated Passages</td>
              <td class="tbordersolid">The SAT reading section is the hardest section on the whole test to master. The passages are more difficult to comphrend and the questions are also more inference-type rather
              than straight from the text. If you struggle with comphrension, it may be a reason to consider the ACT. However, it is masterable with enough effort. </td>
            </tr>
            <td class="tbordersolid">Deeper and more subjective-like questions</td>
            <td class="tbordersolid">The questions have similar answer choices, and students often struggle to pick the right one. This requires deeper practice, but the curve is more forgiving as a result compared to the ACT. If you make silly mistakes a lot, maybe prefer the SAT because
            you can miss 5-7 and still get a 350/400. </td>
            <tr>
              <td class="tbordersolid">Science Passage Majority</td>
              <td class="tbordersolid">3 of the 5 passages are definitely either science or social science. If you're good at nonfiction passages, you may want to consider the SAT. Although the ACT also has a devoted section for scientific experiment comphrension: the sciecne section. See how you perform on the Reading + Science Section and compare them to your reading score and weight which works better.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="tbordersolid">Weightage</td>
              <td class="tbordersolid">The SAT reading section is out of 400 points, which is 25% of the total 1600 possible points. If you're bad at Reading, I suggest the SAT because the ACT has another section called the science section, which is just reading comphrension for science.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <br>

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="tbordersolid">Less Time</td>
              <td class="tbordersolid">With 40 questions in just 35 minutes, this section requires extremely quick reading. Although the questions are more straightforward, teaching yourself to read faster is a tough skill. So I recommend that you give it a shot and see if you can read fast enough. The SAT is better in this department.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="tbordersolid">Passages</td>
              <td class="tbordersolid">The passages are of generally equivalent difficulty compared to the SAT. Although time is much less, so you have to comphrend much quicker. Again, if you're slow, give SAT a point. </td>
            </tr>
            <td class="tbordersolid">Surface Level and Objective Questions</td>
            <td class="tbordersolid">The questions are much more straightforward, but stil require good comphrension. If you usually take your time with questions and need to verify or properly eliminate and check the passage alot, you might want to go with the SAT; on the ACT you won't have much time to decide. </td>
            <tr>
              <td class="tbordersolid">Preparation</td>
              <td class="tbordersolid">The ACT reading is masterable, but when under extreme time pressure, it's sometimes difficult to apply what you have learned. The SAT reading is harder to master, but it's easier to apply what you learned due to the extra time.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="tbordersolid">Weightage</td>
              <td class="tbordersolid">There is one reading section and one science section which is heavy in reading comphrension. This totals to 50% of the test, therefore I would reccommend SAT if you're bad at Reading. <td>

      <td class="tbordersolid">The SAT writing section is extremeley masterable, HOWEVER, there is a subset of questions that require native familiarity.

<h3>How to Decide</h3>
<p>In the end, you need to consider the differences above and take a diagnostic test. Naturally, you will score low in both tests before preparing. Don't just compare the scores though, you want to consider scores you could have after preparing: this can be done by looking at the differences above and judging which test matches you better.</p>
<p>You can convert scores using this <a href="https://www.compassprep.com/concordance-and-conversion-sat-and-act-scores/">article</a> If you still have trouble deciding, you can email us at preplify@gmail.com and tell us your specific situation.</p>
