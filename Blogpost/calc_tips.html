          This article will teach you how to effectively use your calculator and also provides programs for the SAT, SAT Math I, and SAT Math II. If you’re not too familiar with your calculator then this article is perfect for you. The calculator is
          100% optional though as all questions can be answered without one and I only recommend it as a way to do quick arithmetic. It’s good to be adept with a calculator but make sure you fully understand the concepts and don’t depend on it too
          much.<br /><br /> <span class="text_red">DISCLAIMER: </span> <br />If you are using the programs then make sure you know how to use them properly before taking any test. You will find yourself fumbling about and confused if you have no idea
          how the programs work.

        <h3>General Tips</h3>
        <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/calc.jpg" alt="" width="35%" align="right">
        <h4><strong>Tip 1: </strong>Use <span class="text_blue">2nd</span> and <span class="text_green">Alpha</span></h4>

        A calculator isn’t as difficult to use as one might think.<br> If you look at any key you will notice that on top of it it has blue and green text. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>y=</strong> has <span class="text_blue">stat
          plot</span> in blue and <span class="text_green">f1</span> in green. <br><br>That means that if you press <span class="text_blue">2nd</span> or <span class="text_green">alpha</span> and then that button, you can access that command which
        pertains to the color of <span class="text_blue">2nd</span>/<span class="text_green">alpha</span>.<br><br> Following our previous example, if you press <span class="text_blue">2nd</span> and then <strong>y=</strong> then you can access stat
        plots.



        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/quit.jpg" alt="" width="35%" align="right">
        <h4><strong>Tip 2: </strong>Use <span class="text_blue">quit</span></h4>

        Notice how when you use <strong>y=</strong> for plots you can’t get out using the <strong>clear</strong> button. <br>Well, that’s what <span class="text_blue">quit</span> is for!<br><br> It’s the <span class="text_blue">2nd</span> version of
        <strong>mode</strong> and it’s located directly to the right of <span class="text_blue">2nd</span>. <br>You’ll generally be using <span class="text_blue">quit</span> to escape any programs or menus.


        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/math.jpg" alt="" width="35%" align="right">
        <h4><strong>Tip 3: </strong>Use the <strong>math</strong> key</h4>

        The <strong>math</strong> key is the holy grail of advanced techniques.<br> Everything is included here. The first option, >Frac, turns a number into a fraction.<br><br> <strong>Example:</strong> 1.5 >Frac has an output of 3/2. <br><br>You
        can also do the x root of something, factorials, LCM, GCD, and a lot more. Experiment with these options and you will be able to solve any math problem.

        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/entry.jpg" alt="" width="35%" align="right">
        <h4><strong>Tip 4: </strong>Retrieve your previous input</h4>

        You can retrieve your previous input by using <span class="text_blue">2nd</span> → <strong>enter</strong>. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong> if your previous input was 3+8 then it will return 3+8.<br><br> You might use this if you want to
        make small adjustments to that input.

        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/ans.jpg" alt="" width="35%" align="right">
        <h4><strong>Tip 5: </strong>Retrieve your previous output</h4>

        You can retrieve the previous answer by using <span class="text_blue">2nd</span> → <strong>(-)</strong>. <br><br><strong>Example:</strong>If your previous input was 3+8 then it will return 11. <br><br>You might use this if you want to have
        the output only.

        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <h4><strong>Tip 6: </strong>Graph effectively</h4>
        The white buttons at the top of the calculator are used for graphing.

        <br><br>
        • <strong>y=</strong> allows you to enter a function. Use the X key under <strong>mode</strong> for the variable. You can also hide functions by pressing <strong>enter</strong> while highlighting the equals button. The equals button with
        black highlighting means it’s shown while an equal sign without highlighting means it’s hidden. This will allow you to hide functions without having to get rid of the function itself.
        <br><br>• <strong>window</strong> allows you to set the borders of the graph
        <br><br>• <strong>zoom</strong> gives you default window options. Typically use ZStandard (Zoom → 6) so that it all fits. Use ZTrig (Zoom → 7) for anything involving trig
        <br><br>• <strong>trace</strong> lets you trace through the graph. Use the <span class="text_blue">calc</span> option (<span class="text_blue">2nd</span> → <strong>trace</strong>) to obtain useful information such as zeros, minimums, and what
        value y will be with a specific x.
        <br><br>• <strong>graph</strong> lets you have a visual on the function. Use the <span class="text_blue">table</span> option (<span class="text_blue">2nd</span> → <strong>graph</strong>) to obtain a table of xs and ys. Press the + key to
        input your x increment.

        <br id="formulas"><br><br>

        <h3>Create Your Own List of Formulas</h3>

        Some of the programs include trig formulas but they may be clipped if you don’t have the exact model calculator that the programs were intended for. You may also want to create your own personal list of formulas that you don’t remember.
        <br>I’ll teach you my method here.
        <br><br>
        Basically we’re going to create a program but it’s not going to actually do anything; we will only use it as a text file. You’re going to want to go into <strong>programs</strong> (next to <strong>math</strong>) and go all the way to the
        right to create a new program. You can use <span class="text_green">A-lock</span> (<span class="text_blue">2nd</span> → <span class="text_green">alpha</span>) so that every input will be the <span class="text_green">alpha</span> version. This
        will make it so that you can “type.” Type in your formulas and then use <span class="text_blue">quit</span> to leave. Any time you want to check up on your formula list, go back to programs and then go to EDIT. Select your program and you'll
        be able to see your formulas.

        <br id="info_p"><br><br>
        <h3> Important Information Regarding Programs</h3>

        SAT math isn’t that difficult to begin with. If you study properly and take a few practice tests then you will most likely not need these programs. Just regard these as backups. Most of these programs are from <a
          href="https://www.ticalc.org/">ticalc.org</a>. The basic format will look like the image to the bottom. You can download the program by clicking on the bright blue download button. The file will be a ZIP folder and you’ll have to extract
        it. The resulting folder from the extraction will be the one that contains the program. The process is shown in the "How to Download Programs" section. Also, most of these programs come with a ReadMe text file. <span class="text_red">READ
          THEM</span>. They provide documentation on how to use the programs.
        <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/ticalc.png" alt="">

        <br><br id="how"><br><br>
        <h3>How to Download Programs</h3>

        If you’ve never downloaded any programs before, don’t worry! It’s pretty easy. This <a href="https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw">link</a> is for the software used. This video I created gives you the
        general gist of it all. I have also listed the steps below if you don’t want to watch the video.
        <video width="100%" controls>
          <source src="images/download_programs.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          Your browser does not support HTML video.
        </video>

        <br><br>
        1) Download this <a href="https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw">software</a> which will allow you to transfer the programs you download on your computer to your calculator.
        <br><br>
        2) Use the charging cable to connect your computer to your calculator.
        <br><br>
        3) Download and the program and extract the folder if it’s in a ZIP folder
        <br><br>
        4) Drag and drop the program (has the same icon as the TI Connect CE Software) into the software

        <h3>SAT Programs</h3>
        This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8_g9fUGwug">video</a> teaches you how to make programs that will help you with the SAT. It includes programs for the quadratic formula, area of a triangle (Heron’s formula),
        geometric/arithmetic/infinite series, and a few more.
        <br id="sat1"><br><br>

        <h3>SAT Math I Programs</h3>
        This <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/381/38144.html">link</a> provides you with two programs for the SAT Math I. There’s not much documentation for APrime, but it’s basically a program that spits out the prime numbers
        between your two inputs. Keep pressing <strong>enter</strong> to obtain all the primes as it’s not an automatic process. Also, it doesn’t handle large gaps well like 1-100.

        <br id="sat2"><br><br>
        <h3>SAT Math II Programs</h3>

        This is an application called <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/370/37090.html">Alegbra2Plus</a>. Be warned, it is only compatible with TI-84/TI-84 Plus. It does not work with a TI-84 Plus CE. It’s an application so you
        will access it by press the apps button to the right of the math button. You will be able to system of equations, conic sections, coordinate geometry, and a lot more as there are over 60 functions.<br><br>

        This program is called <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/427/42769.html">Cheater v3.0</a> and has an insane amount of stuff. The triangles section is especially useful as you can enter 3 unknowns and it will spit out the
        rest of the missing information. This takes care of the law of sine and cosine. An important thing to note, if you’re using TI-84 Plus CE like I am, your graphing will be messed with a little. You’ll have to fix it by going into <span
          class="text_blue">format</span> (<span class="text_blue">2nd</span> → <strong>zoom</strong>) and turning Axes back on by changing the color (default is black). Also, any functions will be hidden so you will have to unhide them by pressing
        <strong>y=</strong> and pressing <strong>enter</strong> while highlighting the equals sign.
        <br><br>
        This is the final <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/382/38267.html">program</a>. It’s not as expansive as the other programs but it’s still good. This will mess up your graphing like Cheater v3.0 so scroll back up to
        find directions on how to fix it.
